--------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains information about how to install the Statistical Packet
Anomaly Detection Engine (Spade) into Snort.


-= Installation (from tarball) =-

This is what you will need to do to use Spade:

1)  Move your Spade distribution to the top level of your Snort source
distribution.  Alternately edit the top of Makefile and change the SNORTBASE
setting to the location of the top level of your Snort source distribution.

2)  Type 'make' inside the Spade distribution.  If you do not have automake
installed, also type 'make no-automake'.

3)  Compile and install Snort as normal (e.g., ./configure; make)


-= Installation (using Snortenstein) =-

1) Download and unpack the source distribution of Snort if you haven't
already.  You can get it from:

   http://www.snort.org/dl/

2) If you don't have it already, get Snortenstein following the 2 steps
here:

   http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=57280

3) From your Snort distribution directory, run Snortenstein's runme program
with the argument 'snort_1_9/spade'.

   E.g., ../snortenstein/runme snort_1_9/spade

4) Type 'y' for both the packet-cloning and the Spade patch.

5)  Compile and install Snort as normal (e.g., ./configure; make)


-= Installation (for Windows) =-

We're working on installation instruction for Windows.


-= Also =-

A copy of spade.conf is in Snort's etc directory.  spade.conf is now also
added to your snort.conf file.

You may also want to establish a directory in which Spade (while running) can
create a log file and a state file.  The permissions will need to be such that
the snort process can read and create/write these files.
