Changes in Spade version 030125.1 (from 030123.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ minor documentation reformatting


Changes in Spade version 030123.1 (from 030117.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ fixed the packet cloning facility to resolve a bad interaction with
    steam4_reassemble that eventually lead to a segmentation fault
+ did some code and documentation de-tabbing


Changes in Spade version 030117.1 (from 021031.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ fixed problem wherein sometimes Spade wouldn't accept a valid homenet
    [fix by Risto Vaarandi]
+ fixed a bug or two that could cause a seg fault in certain circumstances
+ distributed spade.conf now enables fewer detectors than previously; the
    ones left are the ones that most reliably report on interesting
    traffic.  spade.more.conf has more detectors enabled; use this to look
    for additional types of anomalous traffic.
+ you can now reverse the response waiting type for a Spade detector with
    the advanced option revwaitrpt
+ scalehalflife advanced option added to help set the half life of
    observations
+ reminder added to installation output about installing when you don't
    have automake installed
+ Spade internals now better documented
+ updated documentation


Changes in Spade version 021031.1 (from 021029.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ fixed a bug introduced in the last version causing compiler to complain
    about undeclared variable 'ap'
+ how many packets were stored, how many were anomalous, and overall count
    is now reported accurately in spade log file
+ avoided compiler warning about "subscript has type `char'" that some
    people experienced
+ support added for installing Spade when automake is not available (see
    Installation file)


Changes in Spade version 021029.1 (from 021026.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ fixed installation Makefile; in previous versions it doesn't patch log.c
    correctly (if you use snort -d you may have seen the wrong packet
    displayed in a log file)
+ more Spade warning/error messages will report the offending location in
    your config file (if applicable)
+ some internal cleanup and minor changes


Changes in Spade version 021026.1 (from 021012.1)
--------------------------------------------------
+ ICMP traffic now analyzed for anomalies
  + dead-dest detector type now looks for ICMP traffic to unused IP
    addresses
  + new odd-typecode detector type looks for ICMP packets with rare type
    and code fields
+ new odd-port-dest detector type looks for sources connecting to an
    unusual destination for a destination port (among destination ports
    that are observed to have a predictable set of destinations)
+ you can now exclude certain reports on a Spade-wide basis in addition to
    on a detector-specific basis (add Xdips, Xdports, Xsips, and/or
    Xsports on the main Spade configuration line)
+ dead-dest will no longer report on broadcast IPs
+ sped Spade up a little through some optimizations
+ spade.conf updated for new detection capabilities
+ Spade log file configured in the distributed spade.conf is now called
    spade.log (instead of log.txt) for clarity


Changes in Spade version 021012.1 (from 021008.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ ICMP unreachable messages now processed
  + UDP with closed-dport and odd-dport with response waiting now requires
    an unreachable for a report
  + dead-dest with response waiting uses it as a host-alive indication
+ Fixed oversight whereby Spade's log wasn't always produced
+ Spade's log now includes enhanced information on what each detector did,
    which can guide detector tuning for reports and CPU use
+ Fixed problem with installation Makefile
+ Spade now makes sure each detector has a unique id specified (previously a
    seg-fault eventually occurred)
+ Spade's README and Usage files now installed in snort's 'doc' directory
+ spade.conf now added to snort.conf when installing
+ Responses can now match several reports on the waiting queue
+ Added some more defensive code


Changes in Spade version 021008.1 (from 010818.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ Large expansion of Spade detection capabilities, including:
    + UDP and non-SYN TCP anomaly detection added
    + a new detection type looks for packets to unused IP addresses
    + another new detection type looks for sources using unusual destination
        port numbers
    + you can apply Spade to the outbound direction of your network as well
        as inbound and internal
+ You can now ask Spade to hold a report for a few seconds to see if the
    port is open or closed (bye bye passive FTP reports)
+ Ported to Snort 1.9
+ You have a little more control over what is reported (you can suppress
    certain source or dest networks and source or dest ports)
+ Relative anomaly scores are now standard (unlike the formerly standard raw
    anomaly scores, this has a much more predictable range)
+ Spade alert message strings updated (e.g., now always starts with "Spade",
    indicates detection type, and indicates scope detection was being
    applied to)
+ The way you configure Spade has changed (but backwards compatibility
    preserved); you now enable a number of detectors, all options are in the
    form of <option>=<val>, etc.
+ You can now control whether Spade reports go to the Snort alert facility,
    log facility, or both
+ Documentation significantly updated
+ New, easier installation into Snort
+ You can now specify your Spade homenets in the Snortesque manner of
    [<net>,<net>]
+ spade-threshadvise (formerly called spade-threshlearn) now correctly
    reports how long it ran for
+ Stats mode provides more contextual information
+ The options controlling how Spade's observations decay can now be set in
    the configuration file
+ Spade produces informative log messages as it starts up
+ Spade now checks to make sure the main configuration line is given before
    its other configuration lines (this eliminates an obscure error
    condition when the user forgets the main Spade line)
+ Spade's Snort source files renamed to spp_spade.[ch] from
    spp_anomsensor.[ch] for clarity
+ Packet cloning patch included in installation (this is Snort internal
    functionality that this version of Spade requires)
+ Probably more changes I can't recall right now


Changes in Spade version 010818.1 (from 011701.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ changed version numbering from DDMMYY to YYMMDD to be more clear
internationally and to sort better
+ now produces alerts to all of your Snort output destinations
+ added support for all current versions of Snort
+ added spade-correlate mode to produce IDMEF alerts via TCP sockets (awaits
addition of output plugin message passing into Snort)
+ -corrscore option computes anomaly scores as originally intended (only
matters to a few users)
+ updated documentation


Changes in Spade version 011701.1 (from 092200.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ fixed overlooked initialization in adapt and adapt3 modes that was causing
core dumps for some people near start up [thanks to Craig Barracloug for his
help in tracking this down]
+ fixed bug with use of inet_ntoa that is a problem in a deep debugging mode
[contrib by Paul Cardon]


Changes in Spade version 092200.1 (from 091500.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ renamed a couple internal functions to avoid them being called by the
mysqlclient library and causing a segmentation fault (thanks to
poltrup@ezol.com for his help in tracking this down)


Changes in Spade version 091500.1 (from 091300.1)
--------------------------------------------------

+ moved some global variable declaration to .c files from .h files to avoid
compile errors about redeclarations
